The Code and dataset for the paper “MATDS: Uplift Modeling for Multi-Attribute Treatment under Distribution Shift”

## The synthetic dataset
To construct a synthetic dataset with multiple treatments and inherent bias, while enhancing the complexity of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, two types of covariates are integrated: an adjusted normal distribution and values generated using np.random.choice()



## The public MIMIC-III dataset
