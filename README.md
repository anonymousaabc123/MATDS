The Code and dataset for the paper “MATDS: Uplift Modeling for Multi-Attribute Treatment under Distribution Shift”

## The synthetic dataset
To construct a synthetic dataset with multiple treatments and inherent bias, while enhancing the complexity of the relationship between $X$ and $Y$, two types of covariates are integrated: an adjusted normal distribution and values generated using np.random.choice(). Three implementation methods are given in the code directory
```
- generate_synthetic_data_v1.py: Treatment={0,1,2}, Y={0, 1}, weakly biased
- generate_synthetic_data_v2.py: Treatment={0,1,2,3}, Y={0, 1},  strongly biased
- generate_synthetic_data_v3.py: Treatment={0,1,2,3}, Y={0, 1}, strongly biased
```
Taking the data generated by generate_synthetic_data_v3.py as an example, the data statistics are as follows
| Treatment | Count  | Label_Sum | Response_rate |
|:--------:| :---:|  :---: | :---:  |
| 0 |  2098   | 1031 |  0.491   |
| 1 |  5408   | 3565 |  0.659   |
| 2 |  5453   | 4028 |  0.739   |
| 3 |  2041   | 1476 |  0.723   |
